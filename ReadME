This is my final exam from Sirma Solutions Java academy.

Create an application that identifies the pair of employees who have worked
together on common projects for the longest period of time and the time for
each of those projects.

The first part of the solution was to extract the information from the CSV file.
Then, I check if there are pairs that have worked together and, if so, for how long.
The final part of the solution is printing the formatted data.
